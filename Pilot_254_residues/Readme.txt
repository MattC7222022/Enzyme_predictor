This folder, NN254, contains the python code, models and training data for my 254 amino acid pilot model. It is a simple feed forward NN with a leaky ReLu activation function and only works with amino acids with 254 residues. I only did it with a set of 334 proteins as a pilot project to see if the model was feasible. It was! Got 12% mean error for my best one. I know this isn't amazing, but I don't want to spend tens of hours to marginally improve a preliminary pilot project for my side project.
